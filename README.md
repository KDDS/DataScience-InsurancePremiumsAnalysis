Investigating Job Vacancy and Unemployment Rate Data across Australia

I was required to visualise the relationship between the number of job vacancies, the unemployment rate, and the population of different Australian states, and gain insights from how these relations and trends change over time. The data files used in this task were originally downloaded from the Department of Employment and Australian Bureau of Statistics. Inspirations for analysis was already provided in the form of questions.
